# ‚ö° Forecasting Energy Consumption with Linear LTSF  

A **time-series forecasting project** that leverages **Linear Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF)** models to predict future energy consumption patterns based on historical power usage data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions for better decision-making and energy resource management.  

---

## üìä Project Overview  
Energy consumption forecasting is essential for:  
- **Grid Management:** Optimizing power generation and load balancing  
- **Cost Reduction:** Better energy planning and resource allocation  
- **Sustainability:** Supporting renewable integration by predicting demand  

This project explores **Linear LTSF models** to predict future consumption over multiple time steps, providing a reliable and interpretable solution.

## üß† Workflow  

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Import historical energy usage data  
   - Resample and clean missing values  
   - Normalize features for stable training  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create lag features and sliding windows  
   - Generate datetime-based features (hour, weekday, seasonality)  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Train a Linear Long-Term Series Forecasting model  
   - Compare results with baseline models (e.g., ARIMA or naive forecasts)  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Use metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE  
   - Visualize predicted vs. actual values  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plot energy usage trends  
   - Display future consumption forecasts
